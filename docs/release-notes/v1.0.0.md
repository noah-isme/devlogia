# Devlogia v1.0.0 Stable Release

✅ All phases (1–3) complete  
✅ Stable CI (Playwright container + Postgres service)  
✅ E2E auto-seed pipeline (local & CI)  
✅ Build works DB-less (safeFindMany guard)

### Highlights
- Added automated database seeding before E2E tests.
- Full documentation for local & CI testing workflows.
- Finalized versioning and release notes for v1.0.0.

### Run Tests Locally
```bash
pnpm test:e2e:full
```

### Upgrade Notes
- `pnpm prisma migrate deploy` remains the canonical migration command for production and CI.
- `pnpm prisma db seed` is idempotent — rerunning keeps RBAC, webhook, and AI-assist fixtures fresh.
- `pnpm test:e2e:full` now orchestrates Docker Compose, migrations, seeding, browser installation, and the Playwright run in one command.

### CI Enhancements
- GitHub Actions triggers `pnpm db:up` (skipping gracefully when containers are unavailable), followed by migrations and seeding before launching Playwright.
- Browser dependencies install via `pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps`, ensuring parity across local machines and runners.
- Pipeline order remains `lint → typecheck → test → build → e2e` with all stages green.

### Looking Ahead
- Future iterations can build on the stable baseline to add integrations or UI polish without breaking the automated release flow.
