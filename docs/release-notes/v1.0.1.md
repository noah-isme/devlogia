# Devlogia v1.0.1 (dev)

## ‚ú® Highlights

- Developer experience improvements for local E2E workflows.
- Faster, more reliable CI pipeline with PostgreSQL readiness checks and pnpm caching.
- Production health endpoint and deployment templates for Vercel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes

### Local Tooling
- Added `pnpm dev:seed` helper to bootstrap the database quickly.
- Added PostgreSQL availability checks before running `pnpm test:e2e:full`, skipping the suite gracefully when Docker is offline.
- Introduced reusable `scripts/check-db.js` for connection diagnostics.

### CI/CD
- Added `pg_isready` wait loop in GitHub Actions before running migrations.
- Cached the pnpm store to shorten install times on re-runs.
- Ensured Prisma can build without a live database by injecting a `fake://stub` fallback URL.

### Runtime & Deployment
- Added `/api/health` endpoint returning `{ status: "ok", version: "1.0.1" }`.
- Added `.env.production.example` template with AI/webhook/DB configuration.
- Added `vercel.json` with deterministic install/build commands for Next.js 16 deployments.

## ‚úÖ Verification

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm test:e2e:full` (skips gracefully when Docker/Postgres are offline)
